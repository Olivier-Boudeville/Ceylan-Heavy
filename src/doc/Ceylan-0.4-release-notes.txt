		Ceylan 0.4 release notes
		

This version is built on top of the 0.3 version (see Ceylan-0.4-changes.txt and ChangeLog for more details).

We aimed at an increased portability (Solaris, OpenBSD and Windows XP platforms added).

Other efforts for this version went to the XML read/write support, with a dedicated light-weight parser.
