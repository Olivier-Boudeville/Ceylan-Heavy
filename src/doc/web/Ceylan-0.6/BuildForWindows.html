<h1>How to build Ceylan 0.6 on Windows</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>
The goal here is to explain to developers how to <b>build</b> the 0.6 version of the Ceylan library for Windows, on Windows (no cross-compilation).
</p>

<p>
If a user just needs the Ceylan DLL so that she can <b>run</b> an executable depending on the Ceylan library (only <code>Ceylan-0.6-release-multithread.dll</code>
 is required), then she can download, if available, a <strong>Ceylan prebuilt user package</strong> from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158516" target="_blank">Ceylan File Releases</a> on Sourceforge. If an up-to-date archive is not available, please
<a href="mailto:ceylan@esperide.com?subject=[Ceylan-0.6]%20Windows%20User%20Build%20needed" target="_blank">ask us</a> and we will add it quickly.
</p>

<p>
If a user just want to <b>develop</b> a program or a library depending on the Ceylan library (hence needing Ceylan installed headers, and preferably <code>Ceylan-0.6-debug-multithread.dll</code> and <code>Ceylan-0.6-debug-multithread.lib</code>) and does not wish to build Ceylan by herself, then she can download, if available, a <strong>Ceylan prebuilt developer package</strong> from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158516" target="_blank">Ceylan File Releases</a> on Sourceforge. If an up-to-date archive is not available, please
<a href="mailto:ceylan@esperide.com?subject=[Ceylan-0.6]%20Windows%20Developer%20Build%20needed" target="_blank">ask us</a> and we will add it quickly.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are still reading, then it is that you really want to build the Ceylan library <b>by yourself</b>. This is the recommended way. 
</p>

<p>
Here the target platform is Windows XP, be it Home or Professional edition. Note that we will not have any link with the .NET framework.
</p>


<a name="toolchain"></a>
<h2>Getting the recommended build toolchain</h2>


<h3>C++ compiler and linker</h3>


<h4>Visual Studio 2005</h4>
<p>
On Windows, for the sake of simplicity, no MSYS/MinGW/Cygwin-based approach is recommended by this Ceylan guide, instead of which the proposed method uses <em>Visual Studio 2005</em>, Express edition. It can be <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/" target="_blank">downloaded</a> free of charge, including <em>Visual C++ 2005 Express</em>, which is the IDE and compiler toolchain that we will use here. All these packages can be used freely, including for commercial use, and they are fully functional for our needs. One may install them with default settings (including default paths), for increased safety.
</p>

<p>
Downloading the full MSDN documentation as well is not necessary, but helps a lot whenever developing offline: just select the relevant check-box of the Visual installer, and be prepared to download a global package of approximately 340 mb.
</p>

<p>
Note that you will have to register your <em>Visual Studio 2005</em> copy, otherwise it will cease to work after 30 days (at least if you do not use the procedure to burn an ISO, not tested here). If you want to install these products on multiple computers, you will have to register them on each aimed computer.
</p>


<h4>Platform SDK (PSDK)</h4>

<p>
Once <em>Visual Studio 2005</em> is installed, the platform SDK is needed so that applications using the Win32 runtime (as opposed to the .NET runtime) can be built. Additional header files are indeed required for most Win32 applications. This is the case for Ceylan.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, for numerous functions (such as <code>gethostname</code>), specific headers are required, for example <code>Winsock2.h</code>, which is the file the build will stop at if you try to compile Ceylan without a Platform SDK being correctly installed. These headers are provided with a SDK (<em>Software Development Kit</em>) that has to be installed separatly from the IDE (Visual Express). The goal here is to be able to build Win32 applications, not only .NET ones. 
</p>


<h5>Installing the PSDK</h5> 

<h6>Method #1</h6>
<p>
In the Visual Express start page (just launch the executable), there is a link to install "automatically" this PSDK (Platform-SDK). An error occurred when I clicked on it, but it displayed finally the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/default.aspx" target="_blank"></a> correct web page nevertheless. It explains what should be done to complete the installation, their <code>Step 2</code> will last for a long time. 
</p>

<h6>Method #2</h6>
<p>
An alternate method is to download the PSDK by yourself. See [<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/visualc/aa336404.aspx" target="_blank">1</a>] and [<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=EBA0128F-A770-45F1-86F3-7AB010B398A3&displaylang=en" target="_blank">2</a>].
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, most recent SDK is <code>Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK Full Download</code>, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB&displaylang=en" target="_blank">this page</a>
 and choose to download the <code>PSDK-x86.exe</code> file. Execute it and select the <code>typical</code> installation, which will last for a long time.
</p>


<h5>Configuring Visual Express to use the PSDK</h5> 

<p>
On the Visual Express start page, two methods are explained to update the Visual Express configuration, both seem to work, despite they are not really clear. 
</p>

<p>
One may select, in <code>Tools -&gt; Options</code>, the <code>Projects and solutions</code> panel, in which there is a tab named <code>VC++ directories</code>. Thanks to the drop box, add the suggested paths for executables, includes and libraries.
</p>

<p>
Another way of having this PSDK integrated in Visual Express is to update its configuration file, which in my case was located at <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcpackages\VCProjectEngine.Dll.Express.Config</code>. I searched <code>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;MyUserName&gt;\Application Data\Microsoft\VCExpress</code> for <code>vccomponents.dat</code> but did not find any.
</p>


<h5>Configuring the MSDN Help to manage the PSDK documentation too</h5> 

<p>
One just has to enter, in the help browser URL line, for example <code>ms-help://MS.VSExpressCC.v80/dv_vsexpcc/local/CollectionManagerExpress.htm</code>, select the appropriate PSDK documentation and restart its IDE once again. 
</p>

<p>
To test the result, search for <code>gethostname</code>, the one defined by winsock should be found, whereas without the PSDK help, only the .NET-defined GetHostName or BufferedStream is referenced.

</p>

<p>
Another useful tip is to select other help sources than the local one: "local, then online" for example (see <code>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Help -&gt; Online</code>).
</p>

  

<h5>Parametrizing your projects accordingly</h5> 

<p>
Even though the pre-cooked Ceylan project file comes with the right settings already (hence nothing special to be done here), one should know that there is still a trap with the PSDK: as soon as one includes for example <code>winsock2.h</code> in an extern "C" clause, one encounters numerous errors about anonymous structs in <code>winnt.h</code>.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://community.vietfun.com/printthread.php?t=279103" target="_blank">this page</a>, you need to enable the Microsoft-specific language extensions in your project settings, in <code>C/C++ -&gt; Language</code>. It worked for me, even if it is a pity one could not stick with real ANSI/C.
</p>


<h3>Source control: Subversion (SVN)</h3>

<p> 
To retrieve Ceylan sources, one needs a SVN client, we recommend <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads" target="_blank">Tortoise SVN</a>. One may use as well the SVN client available with Cygwin, although it cannot handle properly long path names. It is convenient for scripting though.
</p>


<h3>Basic shell and terminal: Cygwin (and MSYS)</h3>

<p>
It is in no way necessary, but, among others, <a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> can provide a basic UNIX-like environment, that can be used for example to automate the running of the Ceylan test suite. If not too limited in disk space, one may click on the package setup window to replace <code>All Default</code> by <code>All install</code> to retrieve all Cygwin packages. Numerous packages can be needed, for example by playTests.sh or the LOANI scripts: md5sum, unzip, wget, ping, tar, gunzip, bzip2, svn, etc..
</p>

<p>
Note that in no way the user application, by using Ceylan, will depend on Cygwin DLL (whose licence would not comply with open-source distribution), we are using Cygwin only for their shell and terminal. MSYS could be used as well.
</p>


<h3>Text editor</h3>

<p>
There are plenty of them that are well-designed and open source, for example one may use <a href="http://syn.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Syn</a> or <a href="http://www.jedit.org/" target="_blank">jEdit</a>. Both have some drawbacks though: Syn has a few bugs and does not highlight Erlang syntax, and we did not managed to register jEdit to handle specific file extensions, due to its Java Jar nature. 
</p>


<h2>Getting the Ceylan sources</h2>

<p>
To download the Ceylan sources once Tortoise SVN is installed, right-click in a window showing the content of the folder in which the sources should be transfered to, choose in the menu <code>SVN Checkout</code>, and enter the URL of Ceylan SVN repository: <code>https://ceylan.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ceylan</code>.
</p>

<p>
Prefer performing your check-outs in an absolute path rather close to the root of the filesystem (avoid long pathnames), as various Windows tools are surprisingly limited when dealing with long paths.
</p>


<h2>Configuring the Ceylan library being built</h2>

<p> 
To load the Ceylan project in Visual Express editor, just double-click on the latest <code>Ceylan-0.6.sln</code> file, for example, click on <code>trunk/src/conf/build/visual-express/Ceylan-0.6.sln</code>. Basic settings should be fined for most users, power-users can read the following advanced settings.
</p>


<h3>Ceylan Core</h3>
<p> 
Each Ceylan version comes with a configuration file dedicated to Windows, <code>trunk/src/code/CeylanConfigForWindows.h</code>, which enables only the basic features provided by Ceylan, i.e. the core features (ex: file management), and the ones that are available under all Windows platforms (ex: networking). Most developers shouldn't have to modify it.
</p>


<h3>Ceylan Features</h3>

<h4>How to activate a ported feature</h4>
<p>
Some other features, such as multithreading, plugin support, etc. are not readily available on a vanilla Windows installation, they are therefore initially deactivated. Not all of them have been ported to Windows, hence some of them cannot be available on this platform for the moment.
</p>

<p>
To activate a ported feature (most developers will stick to the default settings and won't change anything here), one has first to declare it is requested, by specifying in <code>trunk/src/code/CeylanConfigForWindows.h</code> the relevant symbol (ex: <code>#define CEYLAN_USES_THREADS 1</code>).
</p>

<p>
Then the relevant additional packages, if any, have to be installed and declared to the IDE. For example, activating the multithreading support would require to have the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/" target="_blank">Windows pthread emulation layer</a> installed beforehand. This feature is currently not ported yet. 
</p>

<p>
More generally, there is at the time of this writing no feature ported to Windows that is not activated by default on Windows builds.
</p>


<h4>Available ported features</h4>

<p>
So, beyond the Ceylan core, following features are readily available in vanilla Windows builds:
<ul>

<!--
	<li><b></b>: </li>
-->

	<li><b>network support</b> [<code>CEYLAN_USES_NETWORK</code>]: it requires that the Winsock2 headers are available, but they should already be obtained by installing the Windows PSDK.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h4>Features that are currently not available</h4>
<p>
Other features are currently not ported to Windows, either:
<ul>

<!--
	<li><b></b>: </li>
-->

	<li>because they do not apply to this platform: 
	  <ul>

		<!--
		<li> [<code></code>]</li>
<	-->

		<li>file descriptor support for non-socket streams [<code>CEYLAN_USES_FILE_DESCRIPTORS]</code></li>
		<li>symbolic links support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_SYMBOLIC_LINKS</code>]</li>
		<li>advanced file attribute support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_ADVANCED_FILE_ATTRIBUTES</code>]</li>
		<li>file lock support<code>[CEYLAN_USES_FILE_LOCKS]</code>]</li>
		<li>advanced process management support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_ADVANCED_PROCESS_MANAGEMENT</code>]</li>
		<li>signal support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_SIGNALS</code>]</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>or because they could be ported, but have not been ported yet:
	  <ul>
		<li>regular expression support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_REGEX</code>]</li>
		<li>multithreading support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_THREADS</code>]</li>
		<li>plugin support [<code>CEYLAN_USES_PLUGINS</code>]</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	
</ul>

</p>


<h2>Generating the Ceylan library</h2>

<p>
One just has to right-click, in the Solution Explorer panel, on <code>Ceylan-0.6-library</code>, select preferably <code>Regenerate</code> and wait for the termination of the build process. That's it. The operation should notably produce, with no warning nor error, <code>Ceylan-0.6-debug-multithread.dll</code> and <code>Ceylan-0.6-debug-multithread.lib</code>, in <code>trunk/src/code</code>.
</p>

<h2>Generating the Ceylan tests</h2>

<p>
One just has to right-click, in the Solution Explorer panel, on the  <code>Ceylan-0.6</code> solution itself, select preferably <code>Generate</code> and wait for the termination of the build process. That's it. It should notably produce, with no warning nor error, the library, if not done already (both .dll and .lib), and the numerous tests, in <code>trunk/test</code>. They can be easily run in a test suite tracking automatically test successes and failures: from a Cygwin terminal, just run <code>playTests.sh</code>, from <code>trunk/test</code>.
</p>

    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
That's it ! You should have here everything needed to make good use of the Ceylan library. 
In case of problem, re-read everything carefully and <a href="mailto:ceylan@esperide.com?subject=[Ceylan-0.6]%20Windows%20Build%20Problem" target="_blank">send us a mail</a>. 
For in-depth technical details about Windows-specific inner workings of Ceylan, one may continue the reading. 
Most people will stop and continue by using by themselves the library.

        </tr>
    </table>
</center>


<h2>Solving other Windows-specific pitfalls</h2>


<h3>Template support with Visual Express</h3>

<p>
There is an issue with Windows DLL and templates, notably STL ones. See this remarkable <a href=" http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/VisualStudio/warningC4251.html" target="_blank">article</a> and the advice in the Microsoft <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q168958/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>. 
</p>


<p> 
This led us to define pragmas around some template constructs in header files, ex:

<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
/* 
 * Takes care of the awful issue of Windows DLL with templates.
 *
 * @see http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/BuildForWindows.html
 * to understand it, and to be aware of the associated risks. 
 * 
 */
#pragma warning( push )
#pragma warning( disable: 4251 )

	std::list<MyClass *> _instances ;

#pragma warning( pop ) 

</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>


<h3>Exporting symbols from DLL</h3>

<p>
During the build on Windows of <b>the Ceylan library</b>, CEYLAN_DLL is expected to be equal to <code>__declspec( dllexport )</code>, ex: <code>CEYLAN_DLL=__declspec( dllexport )</code>.
</p>

<p>
During the build on Windows of <b>code using</b> the Ceylan library, CEYLAN_DLL is expected to be equal to <code>__declspec( dllimport )</code>, ex: <code>CEYLAN_DLL=__declspec( dllimport )"</code>.
</p>

<p>
These CEYLAN_DLL symbols are defined accordingly on Windows in the C/C++ preprocessor defines panel (library properties), and on UNIX they are replaced by an empty value, thanks to <code>-D</code> command-line preprocessor defines set at configure-time.
</p>

<p>When writing code (in the Ceylan library), CEYLAN_DLL is to be specified on:
<ul>

<!--
	<li><b></b>: </li>
-->

	<li>exported <b>class declarations</b>, ex:
	<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
class CEYLAN_DLL WhiteNoiseGenerator: public RandomGenerator { ...
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

	</li>
	
	<li>exported <b>non-method functions</b>, ex:
<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
CEYLAN_DLL Ceylan::Float32 Sqrt( Ceylan::Float32 x ) ;
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>
	
	</li>
	
	<li>exported <b>symbols</b>, ex: 
<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
extern CEYLAN_DLL const SignalNumber BrokenPipe ;
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>
	
	</li>
	
</ul>

</p>

<p>	
Special management for the <code>extern</code> keyword, with for example:
<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
CEYLAN_EXTERN_TEMPLATE template class CEYLAN_DLL std::list<Ceylan::EventListener *> ;
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

does not seem necessary, according to our tests.
</p>


<h3>Understanding preprocessor symbols used to detect the Windows platform</h3>

<p>
There are two of them:

<ul>

<!--
	<li><b></b>: </li>
-->

	<li><code>CEYLAN_RUNS_ON_WINDOWS</code>: this symbol is to be used in Ceylan public headers only, both by the Ceylan library itself and <b>by libraries and executables using it</b>, so that compiler-specific and platform-specific issues can be solved (ex: Windows socket descriptors cannot be directly mapped to UNIX file descriptors). This is the only case where total encapsulation of specific datatypes was not enforced, for the sake of simplicity and efficiency. All other cases that would impact the UNIX build have been encapsulated, see <code>Ceylan::System::Thread::SystemSpecificThreadIdentifier</code> for instance. As <code>CEYLAN_RUNS_ON_WINDOWS</code> is not defined on UNIX, on these platforms installed headers are indeed free from configuration-specific informations</li>
	
	<li><code>CEYLAN_ARCH_WINDOWS</code>: this is a usual CEYLAN_ARCH_* symbols, only used for the Ceylan internal implementation (*.cc), user code does not need to know it</li>
	
</ul>	
</p>
	

<h3>Setup of executables or libraries using the Ceylan library</h3>

<p>
Each of those Ceylan-dependent binaries must define:
<ul>

<!--
	<li></li>
-->

	<li>in <code>Configuration Properties -&gt; C++ -&gt; General -&gt; Additional include directories</code>, the path to a directory containing all the Ceylan headers must be specified. This is needed for compiling. Such a directory is provided in the case <a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net/OSDL-latest/LOANI.html" target="_blank">LOANI</a> is used, otherwise one might copy all the headers in one directory by oneself, or specify them directly from the Ceylan build tree, with something like:
<code><pre> "$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/generic";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/interfaces";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/logs";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/maths";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/middleware";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/modules";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/network";"$(CeylanBaseDir)/src/code/system
 </pre></code>	
	
  </li>
	<li>in <code>Configuration Properties-&gt; C++ -&gt; Preprocessor Definitions</code>: <code>"CEYLAN_DLL=__declspec( dllimport )";"CEYLAN_RUNS_ON_WINDOWS=1"</code>. This is needed for compiling.</li>
	
	<li>that it references the Ceylan library: in <code>Project Dependencies</code>, check Ceylan-0.6-library. This is needed for linking. Alternately, one can just specify, in the linker settings, an additional dependency, <code>Ceylan-0.6-{debug|release}-mt.lib</code>, and adjust the additional library directories accordingly.</li>
	
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In the linker settings, <code>Generate Debug informations</code> may be set to yes, according to the user needs. For all these settings, one may refer to the Ceylan property sheets, in <code>trunk/src/conf/build/visual-express</code>: <code>CeylanProperties.vsprops</code> for the library, <code>CeylanPropertiesForTests.vsprops</code> for code using it.
</p>



<h3>Manifests</h3>
<p> 
We do not know for the moment whether manifests solve or are another form of DLL hell, so we keep them on with default settings, it seems to work correctly.
</p>

	<li>choose project <b>location</b> in the relevant module, ex: <code>trunk/test/generic</code> for <code>testCeylanBasicResourceManager</code></li>
	
	<li>remove <b>default</b> directories: Header, Resource, Source Files</li>
	
	<li>add in project an <b>existing element</b>, ex: <code>testCeylanBasicResourceManager.cc</code>, which should lie in the parent directory of the one of this test</li>
	
	<li>
	<p>
	set all the test settings. Now the method is utterly simple, it just involves adding to the test project a property sheet (use the <code>Property Manager</code> tab), namely <code>trunk/src/conf/build/visual-express/CeylanPropertiesForTests.vsprops</code> and adding a reference to the Ceylan library to link to: go to the project <b>properties,</b>, in <code>Common Properties -&gt; References</code>, click on <code>Add New Reference</code> and select <code>Ceylan-x.y library</code>
	</p>

	<p>
Previous actions used to be (there are deprecated now, as not centralized in a shared property sheet and hardcoding debug/release settings for example) :
	<ul>
	
		<li>In <b>configuration properties</b>,
	  		<ul>

	<!--
		<li></li>
	-->

			<li>set <code>General -&gt; Output Directory</code> to ".."</li>
			<li>add in <code>C/C++ -&gt; General -&gt; Additional Include Directories</code>:
			<center>
    	<table summary="Code" style="border: none">
       	<tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
"$(SolutionDir)code";"$(SolutionDir)code/generic";"$(SolutionDir)code/interfaces";"$(SolutionDir)code/logs";"$(SolutionDir)code/maths";"$(SolutionDir)code/middleware";"$(SolutionDir)code/modules";"$(SolutionDir)code/network";"$(SolutionDir)code/system"
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    	</table>
			</center>
		</li>
		
		<li>add in <code>C/C++ -&gt; Preprocessor -&gt; Preprocessor Definitions</code>: <code>"CEYLAN_DLL=__declspec( dllimport )"; "CEYLAN_RUNS_ON_WINDOWS=1"</code></li>

		<li>choose in <code>C/C++ -&gt; Code Generation -&gt; Runtime Library</code>: <code>"Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)"</code>. Selecting "Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)", "Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)" or "Multi-thread (/MT)" leads to a direct crash.</li>
		
		<li>choose in <code>Linker -&gt; Debugging</code>:
<code>"Generate Debug Info: Yes (/DEBUG)"</code></li>

	      </ul>
	    </li>
		
	  </ul>
	</li>
	
	
	<li><b>rename</b> in the IDE the project, so that it is prefixed by its module. Ex: <code>testCeylanBasicResourceManager</code> becomes <code>generic-testCeylanBasicResourceManager</code>. It allows to sort the projects in the IDE panel without having the long names in the filesystem</li>
	
	<li><b>build</b> the project</li>
	
	<li>from a cygwin terminal, go to <code>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;MyUserName&gt;\My Documents\Ceylan\trunk\src\code\</code> for example (a symbolic link is useful here), and run for example (check the logs and the return code): <code>../../test/generic/generic-testCeylanBasicResourceManager.exe --consolePlug; echo $?</code>. Doing so allows to use the latest Ceylan DLL file (<code>Ceylan-0.6-debug-multithread.dll</code>), that is generated in <code>src/code</code>. Another solution to find the Ceylan library is to copy the test executable to the directory in which the DLL is generated (<code>trunk/src/code</code>)</li>

	<li><b>add</b> the project file to SVN repository: for example, right-click on the <code>trunk/test/generic/testCeylanBasicResourceManager</code> directory, and select only <code>testCeylanBasicResourceManager.vcproj</code></li>

</ol>
</p>


<p>
The <code>test*.vcproj</code> files could be generated automatically, but it would not be far more convenient (generate a GUID, register to the solution, etc.).
</p>
	
	
<p>
The recommended way of <b>retrieving</b> the Ceylan library on Windows is to check-out a stable (tag-based) SVN tree: the source archive is a tar.bz2, which is not very convenient.
</p>
	
<p>
The recommended way of <b>testing</b> the Ceylan library is to check-out a stable (tag-based) SVN tree and to run the testing suite from a Cygwin terminal, since the script playTests.sh can be run on all supported platforms, including Cygwin-based Windows (note that Cygwin is used only for the shell and UNIX commands it provides; none of its libraries is used by Ceylan): <code>cd trunk/test && ./playTests.sh</code>.
</p>
	
<p>
Beware to your firewall, that should detect that the tests use the network and that they change at each new build: you must use your firewall (ex: ZoneAlarm) to authorize these tests, so that the test suite can run fine. Or you may modify playTests.sh so that, even when it detects network availability, it does not pass the --online option to the tests: doing so will prevent the tests from using the Internet, with DNS queries for example (however local client/server instances will still be created and be detected by your firewall).
</p>
	
<p>
Note also that if your firewall pops up a window asking the user whether a test executable can access a network interface, then most probably the test will fail because of a time-out: the time needed for the user to answer will be fatal, the test manager will believe that such long durations are abnormal. One thus has to stop and re-run the test suite, and acknowledge the related firewall requests until all needed executables have been granted the right to access the network, so that the test suite can be non-interactive once again.

The <code>ldd</code> tool is lacking on the Windows platform, one may use <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" target="_blank">Dependency Walker</a> instead.
