	<dt>2007, July 13, Friday</dt>
	<dd>Getting ready for cross-compilation to the <a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/misc/nintendo-DS/HomebrewForDS.html" target="_blank">Nintendo DS</a>.</dd>

	<dt>2007, March 28, Wednesday</dt>
	<dd>Development on the 0.6 version started.</dd>

	<dt>2007, March 20, Tuesday</dt>
	<dd>Many small fixes and additional services added in support of the OSDL 0.4 version. This will lead to a Ceylan 0.5 version once ported again to Windows, tested and released at the same time as OSDL will be released.</dd>
	
	<dt>2007, February 3, Sunday</dt>
	<dd>Many improvements in the build (autotools) and documentation systems integrated. Lot of reformattig as well: 80 character width enforced.</dd>

	<dt>2006, December 9</dt>
	<dd>Ceylan 0.4 released ! This version includes a custom-made XML parser (read/write in file and in a DOM-like tree in memory), and adds three supported platforms: Windows XP, Solaris 9, and OpenBSD 3.8. No new Ceylan version scheduled before some time (at most bug fixes only in the next months), since work will mainly happen on OSDL from now.</dd>

	<dt>2006, September 12</dt>
	<dd>Ceylan 0.3 released ! This version is a major milestone, and is very different from the 0.2 version. We aimed at an increased portability (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, et NetBSD, 32 or 64 bit) and modularity (full autotools support added).
 A lot of efforts for this version went to the networking support.</dd>

	<dt>2005, November 29</dt>
	<dd>Some more basic datatypes added. Thinking to a FreeBSD port.</dd>

	<dt>2005, October 4</dt>
	<dd>After holydays and much time passed reading Harry Potter, <code>Clonable</code> interface has been proof-tested, gcc 3.4.x is now supported, <code>toString</code> operations have been improved for non-base 10 outputs. Some scripts added as well</dd>
  
	<dt>2005, September 2</dt>
	<dd><code>ResourceManager</code> classes have been improved again, now they are (hopefully) in their final state, as extensive testing showed</dd>
  
	<dt>2005, July 15</dt>
	<dd>A smart policy-based resource cache, based on C++ inherited templates, has been added and tested, after more efforts than expected. Very convenient for example to cache precomputed glyphs for a text rendering system</dd>

	<dt>2005, April 12</dt>
	<dd>Some basic character support (Latin-1, Unicode, UTF-8) has been added</dd>

	<dt>2005, February 27</dt>
	<dd>Listener-driven and source-driven MVC framework finished and fully tested, scheduling and time management improved</dd>


	<dt>2005, February 11</dt>
	<dd>A reverse (listener-based) MVC framework is needed by OSDL scheduler scheme, so Ceylan is adding specialized MVC support.</dd>

	<dt>2005, January 14</dt>
	<dd>Oops, forgot to update the Ceylan news for a while ! Plenty of new developements added, including a powerful HTML logging, linear algebra (including 4x4 homogeneous transformations), referential trees, Model-View-Controller framework, and many more features...</dd>

	<dt>2004, February 13</dt>
	<dd>
	News section at last inaugurated ! As our game creation club was heavily working on <a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">OSDL</a>, little time was available to set up Ceylan's website. Some improvements are being amde now, at last.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>2004, in the beginning</dt>
	<dd>
	Ceylan's 0.2 version was started, since the 0.1 had been screwed up by a mistake with <code>cvs import</code>. Not that glorious !
	</dd>
