		Ceylan 0.7 release notes

Now released under a disjunctive bi-license LGPL/GPL (choose the one you prefer).

This version is mainly a bug-fixes only release, as Ceylan is already stable and quite complete (see Ceylan-0.7-changes.txt and ChangeLog for more details).

		
Support available through the ceylan-support@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
