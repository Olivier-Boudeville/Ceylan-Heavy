		TO-DO list for the Ceylan project, release @CEYLAN_VERSION@
		 
			
		
Tasks priorities, shown between brackets, range from 1 (the smallest priority) to 10 (the top).

Tasks are listed thematically, in each theme from the most important task to the least.

First concern: add only functionnalities really needed, mainly by the OSDL project.



* Build:

	[1] add support for the Intel icpc compiler
	
		
		
* Generic functionnalities:

	[5] ensure that a stripped-down version of the library can be used, at least to save some RAM space on the Nintendo DS
	[4] add localization service (XML-based?) to support various languages
	[4] add security service, including encryption, private/public key (by means of other libraries)
	[4] add word-generator service (or in OSDL?)
	[3] ensure modularity is effective, that it is simple to add new components or replace/specialize existing ones on a project-by-project basis
	[3] set optimizing services (runtime profiling), hand-written or reused: look for what is available too
	[2] add a configuration helper (settings registery), which is able to read and write various properties (almost already done thanks to our XML parser)
	[2] use data compression algorithm (mainly lossless), to be used for files and network (by means of other libraries)
  	


* Math:

	[3] add parametrized movements
	[2] add Runge-Kutta (order 4) solver for physics engine
	


* System:
	
		
	
* Events:

	
		
* Network:

	[2] add ASN.1-based cross-platform message-based networking (see esnacc)
	[2] add network services such as file transfer, dynamic code and data retrieval based on cache and versions, on-the-fly compression
	
	
	
* Documentation:

	[5] update HTML documentation: architecture, high level API description
	[4] create Ceylan's user guide, it should be designed in a way that is fairly simple to understand and teach (docbook)
	[2] add in header files something like:

* Log system:

	[2] create a parser which adds/removes, at will, log overhead
	[2] support for format-strings as printf does it
	[1] store log messages in an external file (classical or XML) so that localization is easier: no hard-coded sentences
		
	
	
* Binding:	

	[6] client using Ceylan, game server using Erlang, communicating with ASN.1
	[1] python / C++ integration module, using Boost.python, if ever needed
	


* Cross-platform:
	
	[5] add Microsof Vista and Seven support (port everything in Ceylan, not helper libs)
	[4] add Mac OSX support (port everything in Ceylan, not helper libs)
	[1] add AIX, IRIX, HP-UX platforms

	
	
* Quality:

	[3] use unit-testing as much as possible
	[3] use Valgrind to check memory management
	[0] use astyle to ensure source code uniformity (might be a bad idea) [only on contributed code?]
