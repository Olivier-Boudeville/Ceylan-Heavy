I would like to thank here some colleagues of mine who, being C++ gurus, helped me a lot.

I would like to thank also the full team of our game creation club, also known as the 'Club of the Floodlit Coypus', for their constant encouragements and their art of faking the belief that some day my developments will work as expected.


Specific thanks include :

	* Alexandre Makarenko, for granting me to reuse various C++ parts of his awesome developments
	* Marc Petit, for his templated generic containers and for many hints about C++ good practises
	* Asmodehn Shade <asmodehn@gmail.com>, for his help regarding the dreadful porting effort
