		Ceylan 0.3 release notes
		

This version is a major milestone, and is very different from the 0.2 version (see Ceylan-0.3-changes.txt and ChangeLog for more details).

We aimed at an increased portability (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, et NetBSD, 32 or 64 bit) and modularity (full autotools support added). 

A lot of efforts for this version went to the networking support.
