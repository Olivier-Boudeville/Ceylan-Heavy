		Ceylan 0.3 release notes
		

This version is a major milestone, and is very different from the 0.2 version (see Ceylan-0.3-changes.txt and ChangeLog for more details).

We aimed at an increased portability and modularity. Even if they are improved, there are still some more efforts to plan before meeting our requirements.
