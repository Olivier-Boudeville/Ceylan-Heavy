% Unit tests for the implementation of trace management.
%
% See the following modules:
%  - class_TraceAggregator
%  - class_TraceSupervisor
%
% Note: trace services are among the most generic services offered, they are
% used in the vast majority of tests but this one, as the purpose of this test
% is actually to test traces by themselves (cannot use the trace system to test
% the trace system!).
-module(traceManagement_test).


-define(Tested_modules,[ class_TraceEmitter, class_TraceAggregator,
	class_TraceSupervisor, class_TraceListener ]).


% For trace facilities:
-include("traces_for_tests.hrl").



-define(Prefix,"--> ").



% Run the tests.
%
% Note: this is the only test that does not use the trace functionalities for
% its own behaviours (since it is the subject of the test).
