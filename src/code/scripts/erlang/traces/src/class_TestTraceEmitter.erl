% Test of TraceEmitter class.
% See class_TraceEmitter.hrl and class_TraceEmitter.erl.
-module(class_TestTraceEmitter).


% Determines what are the mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( wooper_superclasses, [class_TraceEmitter]).


% Parameters taken by the constructor ('construct'). 
-define( wooper_construct_parameters, TraceEmitterName ).


% Declaring all variations of WOOPER standard life-cycle operations:
% (template pasted, two replacements performed to update arities)
-define( wooper_construct_export, new/1, new_link/1, 
		synchronous_new/1, synchronous_new_link/1,
		synchronous_timed_new/1, synchronous_timed_new_link/1,
		remote_new/2, remote_new_link/2, remote_synchronous_new/2,
		remote_synchronous_new_link/2, remote_synchronous_timed_new/2,
		remote_synchronous_timed_new_link/2, construct/2, delete/1 ).



% Member method declarations.
-define( wooper_method_export, sendTraces/1, sendAsyncTraces/1 ).

-export([ send_traces/1, send_traces_benchmark/1 ]).


% Allows to define WOOPER base variables and methods for that class:
-include("wooper.hrl").


% Only to test the trace system:
-define(LogPrefix,"[Test TraceEmitter]").


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define(TraceEmitterCategorization,"TraceEmitter.Test").

% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("class_TraceEmitter.hrl").
