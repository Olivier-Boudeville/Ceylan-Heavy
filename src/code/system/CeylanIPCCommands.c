/**
 * This include file centralizes the system (Ceylan-specific) command
 * identifiers for the FIFO-based IPC, notably for the Nintendo DS.
 *
 * It is to be included by ARM7 C code and ARM9 C++ code.
 *
 * typedef for FIFOCommandID is expected to be already defined (it cannot be
 * defined here as its definition is specific to each ARM: Ceylan::Uint8/uint8).
 *
 * enum not used as are int, thus 32-bit, whereas we want 8 bit.

/**
 * System-specific command identifier values range from 0 to 127.

 * which reserved [32..96]. 
 *
 * Hence other libraries can use [97..127], and each application can use
 * [128..255].
