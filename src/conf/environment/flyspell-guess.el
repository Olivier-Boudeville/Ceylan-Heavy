;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Brand new version of flyspell-guess. It uses a new sampling algorithm that
;;  boosts guess speed and accuracy.

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  Load it as usual, ie. put this file in the Emacs-Lisp load path and add the
;;  following to your dot-emacs startup file:
;;
;;     (require 'flyguess)
;;
;;  This way flyguess will load every time you start Emacs; the insinuation of
;;  the guess indicator is now automatic so that's really it.

;;; Usage:
;;
;;  (flyguess-buffer) tries to guess the language of the current buffer --
;;  let's call it the guessing buffer. Depending on the language(s) used in the
;;  guessing buffer, a certain amount of text is needed for a successful
;;  guess. If flyguess gets puzzled it enters the supplicant mode, otherwise it
;;  will plug the guessed language dictionary and turn on flyspell. Please note
;;  that flyguess won't mess with buffers other than the guessing one, so you
;;  can have as many guessing buffer as you like and flyguess will operate on
;;  all of them seamlessly.

;;  When in supplicant mode flyguess periodically tries to guess the language
;;  of the guessing buffer with a given time interval (see the flyguess
;;  customization page for the details on the poll-timeout.) Flyguess will only
;;  exit the polling mode when either it finds a suitable language or the
;;  guessing buffer gets killed.
;;
;;  When flyguess is idle (ie. it is awaiting the expiration of the polling
;;  timeout) the "[?]" indicator will be shown on the mode-line of the guessing
;;  buffer (again, see the flyguess customization page for details on the
;;  indicator-format.) Once the polling timeout expires, the indicator changes
;;  in "[G]" and the guessing procedure starts immediately after. If no
;;  suitable language is found, the indicator is reverted back to "[?]" and
;;  flyguess turns idle again. The indicator is removed from the mode-line as
;;  soon as a suitable language is found.

;;  Sometimes the guessing procedure could be very quick so the "[G]" indicator
;;  won't ever show up on the mode-line; clearly this is not a bug. Depending
;;  on your hardware setup, you could need to tweak the options of the guessing
;;  engine in the customization page; ideally the time spent for a guess
;;  shouldn't last longer than 500ms or so.

;;; Known Bugs:
;;
;;  So far so good ;-)

;;; Comments:
;;
;;  Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are welcome.
;;  Please send them to Alessandro Di Marco (dmr@ethzero.com).
;;
;;  This version of flyguess was developed and tested with GNU Emacs 24.3.91.1
;;  under Linux. Please, let me know if it works with other OS and versions of
;;  Emacs.
