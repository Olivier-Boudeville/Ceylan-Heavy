# See https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuScreen to avoid screen's Ctrl-a
# interfering with Emacs conventions.



# To replace Ctrl-a (emacs conventions):
# Ctrl-o is already used by nano:
#escape ^Oo

# Ctrl-Space:
escape ^@@


# Do not trash BackSpace, usually DEL:
bindkey -k kb
bindkey -d -k kb

# Do not trash Delete, usually ESC [ 3 ~:
bindkey -k kD
bindkey -d -k kD

# Set scrollback buffer to 10000
defscrollback 10000
